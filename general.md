This start a simple web server:

json-server db.json

db.json contains a json object of all the type or tables in the database.


$ json-server --watch db.json

By using this parameter weâ€™re making sure that the server is started in watch mode which means that it watches for file changes and updates the exposed API accordingly.

A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a Content-Type: application/json header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.

###Sample Table ###

{
  "employees": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "first_name": "Sebastian",
      "last_name": "Eschweiler",
      "email": "sebastian@codingthesmartway.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 2,
      "first_name": "Steve",
      "last_name": "Palmer",
      "email": "steve@codingthesmartway.com"
    },
    {
      "id": 3,
      "first_name": "Ann",
      "last_name": "Smith",

}
