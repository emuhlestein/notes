## JSON Server

JSON Server is a Node Module that you can use to create demo rest json webservice in less than a minute. All you need is a JSON file for sample data.

To install json server:  
    
    $npm install -g json-server
    

This start a simple web server:
    
    json-server db.json
    
db.json contains a json object of all the type or tables in the database.


$ json-server --watch db.json

By using this parameter weâ€™re making sure that the server is started in watch mode which means that it watches for file changes and updates the exposed API accordingly.

A POST, PUT or PATCH request should include a Content-Type: application/json header to use the JSON in the request body. Otherwise it will result in a 200 OK but without changes being made to the data.

### Sample Table ###
A sample db.json database file:  

    {
        "employees": [
            {
                "id": 1,
                "first_name": "Sebastian",
                "last_name": "Eschweiler",
                "email": "sebastian@codingthesmartway.com"
            },
            {
                "id": 2,
                "first_name": "Steve",
                "last_name": "Palmer",
                "email": "steve@codingthesmartway.com"
            },
            {
                "id": 3,
                "first_name": "Ann",
                "last_name": "Smith",
                "email": "ann@codingthesmartway.com"
            }
       ] 
    }


npm install <package> This install the package into node_modules
  
npm install --save <package> This installs the package into node_modules and updates the package.json file, making this package a dependency for the project.
  
npm install --save-dev <package>  This installs the package and updates package.json to creates dev dependency.

Need to read about the npm left-pad problem.

yarn is like npm.
