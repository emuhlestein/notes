Node.js
[About Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/about/)

Node.js is "an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime, Node.js is designed to build scalable network applications...Users of Node.js are free from worries of dead-locking the process, since there are no locks. Almost no function in Node.js directly performs I/O, so the process never blocks. Because nothing blocks, scalable systems are very reasonable to develop in Node.js."

"Electron JS is a runtime framework that allows the user to create desktop-suite applications with HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. Itâ€™s an open source project started by Cheng Zhao, an engineer at GitHub.
